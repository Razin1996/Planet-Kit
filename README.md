Our proposed device will have necessary equipment to carry out several lab tests which are crucial to detect bio-signatures, weather, soil condition, water detection in Mars. Those data will help them to sustain their life in Mars.


    About us:

We are a research group from BRAC University, working on several space exploration projects for few years. Recently we have attended different mars exploration challenges such as URC and IRC. We have also collaborated with “Naster Lab” which is the control and monitoring station of 1st nano-satellite of Bangladesh “BRAC Onnesha”. Now, we are looking forward to develop a portable device called “Planet Kit” which will help to sustain the survival’s life on mars.

Our team consists of five specialist members skilled in software, electronics, microbiology, 3D designing and video editing.

    Target Area:

During colonizing on Mars, people will face challenges by the harsh environment. Our device will help those survivors to sustain their life. To survive on a planet the most important components are fresh air, suitable ground & drinkable water. But environment of mars is poisonous due to sulfur cloud and other poisonous gas. Very essential oxygen has decreased because of oxidization of ground metal. The main challenge is growing their own food and collecting drinkable water. That is why we are focusing on those problems and developing a portable survival kit.

    Our solution:

Our prototype is a Briefcase shaped device which is a portable laboratory consists of drill for collecting soil sample, water purifier (Vapor-compression desalination) and various sensors. There is also a display with an on-board computer to show & analyze those data. Our device consists of various Gas detectors like CO, CO2, nitrogen, Argon and Air humidity. Others includes Air temperature, Air pressure sensors. For further analysis of the environment it has Radiation sensor, ambient light sensor. For soil evaluation & detect bio-signature it has Soil moisture +soil temperature probe. Our device also has an emergency situation alarm integrated with environment sensors and emergency oxygen backup.

1.Soil analysis:

One of the special features includes spectrophotometer which uses Acid Hydrolysable Phosphorus reagents to mix with soil to detect nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus and pH level. In future we want to install UV & IR spectrum producer with Spectrophotometer for more qualitive analysis.

2.Control Board:

All this are controlled by several microcontrollers connected to a central processing unit. For power we are developing solar panel system and alternatively from rotary motion of briefcase (Planet Kit) wheels.


3.Path record and navigation:

We are developing full offline navigation without GPS using 3 axis auto calibrated magnetometer, Altimeter, accelerometer, a rotary encoder and Geo-referencing Raster Data from mars map repository of NASA to create offline map.With the help of LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), wide angle camera and photogrammetry method we are developing reality-based generation of virtual environments of mars.


4.Testing:

We already tested our sensors in Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) which is the second of four planned simulated Mars surface exploration habitats, as we are developing this device such a way so that it can adopt on any space environment. However, to achieve this goal we need more organized laboratory with advance equipment like a simulation lab capable of replicating space environment.


    Change it can make:

Our device will open the opportunity to explore beyond of our solar system and make possible direct human connection to space. It is crucial for the survival of human race as we are running out of valuable resources which are available in distant planets. As these intergalactic changes and events carries the vital information about the fate of our planet, our “Planet kit” will play a vital role for human race.
